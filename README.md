# Announcement Workshop

The next MoBPS workshop will be in-person in Wageningen on April 28 & 29. 

For registration see https://wias.crs.wur.nl/courses/details/1632/

The subsequent workshop is planned to be fully remote/online and will most likely be in Spring 2026

# MoBPS
This repository contains our R-package MoBPS and the associated packages (miraculix/RandomFieldsUtils/MoBPSmaps).
A manuscript for the package is published in G3 Genes Genomes Genetics (https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/10/6/1915/6026363)
 
The package is designed in a way to allow for a maximum of flexibility and possible extensions in basically any step of the simulation. In case you feel like a specific functionally or option is missing in the program just contact me (torsten.pook@uni-goettingen.de). 
I would highly appreciate detailled explanation of the genetics/breeding you are trying to model to make it easier for me to add in the options needed in an efficient manner. 

Same goes for questions regarding the tool or how to set up your simulation. We are always happy for questions as it really helps improve the tool. For quick reply it would help to provide a small example of our problem (ideally the population-list as a .RData object)

Hopefully our extensive User Manual containing some exemplary simulation should answer most questions but it can definitly be still improved. Slide from presentations / working paper are available on request.

We are always thankful for advice, for additional things to implement, feedback and/or reports of errors.

# Web-based interface
The web-based interface is finally online at www.mobps.de.

For testing we are providing a Guest User. This user is not allowed to use our backend server simulations, but can at least try to set up his simulations and download resulting json-files that can than be simulated via json.simulation() in the MoBPS R-package.

A separate publication of the web-based framework is also published in G3 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712818/). Extended documenation for the interface can be found at www.mobps.de directly.
