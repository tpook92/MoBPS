#' Number of individuals

#' Function to calculate the number of individuals in the population list
#' @param population Population list
#' @param database Groups of individuals to consider for the export
#' @param gen Quick-insert for database (vector of all generations to export)
#' @param cohorts Quick-insert for database (vector of names of cohorts to export)
#' @param count.copy Set to TRUE to double count individuals if multiple copies of an individual are included in gen/database/cohorts
